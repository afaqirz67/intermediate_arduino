 ## LED FADE
 
Using CirciutPython I developed code to make an led light slowly get brighter and then to slowly face back until it is very dim. To do this I had to utilize PWM, pulse width modification, and dutycycle which control the amount of energy/pulse/voltage that is sent to the the LED making it fade.

### Lessons Learned
I learned the basics of Circuitpython and its differences from arduino coding. Specifically, I learned how to import libraries into Circuitpython by writing at the top of your code "import *library*". I also gained an understanding of dutycycle, the part of the code that controls the amount of time the led is ON compared to the time it taks to complete the cycle. This caused the LED to fade.
